This is pingr, a dumb application to test Google App Engine's XMPP support. You can read more about it at http://www.paulhammond.org/2009/09/pingr/

To get a dev environment set up:

1. Install the App Engine SDK, by following the instructions at http://code.google.com/appengine/docs/gettingstarted/devenvironment.html
2. run "dev_appserver.py /path/to/pingr"

If you've made changes and you'd like to deploy them to Google's servers:

1. sign up at http://appengine.google.com/, click "create an application" and fill in the form
2. edit the first line of app.yaml to use your application identifier
3. run "appcfg.py update /path/to/pingr"
